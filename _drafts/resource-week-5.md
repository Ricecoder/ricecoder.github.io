This article demonstrates how to create a full page background image in CSS. 

The image will:

* Fill the page without leaving white spaces
* Be responsive
* Be centered
* Be cross-browser compatible
* Not cause scrollbars
* Use only CSS and not Flash to accomplish this.

Using the CSS3 the article demonstrates how by using the `html` tag as opposed to the `body` tag we know that the image will always display at least the height of the browser window. Using  the `background-size` property set to `cover` we can further adjust the size.

There are also alternate versions for accomplishing the same thing through different CSS and HTML methods.
