##Journal Week 7

Working in groups this week was both challenging and great. While the logistics of having multiple people working on one assignment at once made things a nightmare at times, I really enjoyed learning the git flow process. I found I became much more mindful of everything I did because I knew that it effected not only my code but others' as well.

Being a team leader was very insightful. Having to focus on the big picture and not an individual task was a great exercise in how to view an assignment.
Too often I focus on each individual task, connecting them when they are all complete, only to find out that things don't work as well together as I had hoped. 
I really enjoyed being able to help my teammates work through problems they might be having. Though it was hard not to being coding, not having to work on my own
file meant that I had the time to really help out and trouble shoot some difficult things. I also was able to do research and come up with different solutions while my
teammates kept working. In the end I found this accelerated the processes tremendously.

Working with a team leader also had many benefits as well. When I found myself stuck on something I knew I had someone there
to help work through it which was invalueable. I also found that having someone keeping an eye on the big picture was 
extremely helpful. Often times they would give suggestions on things that would benefit us down the road, like more semantic 
html tags or specific selectors in sass. 

All in all I found my experience working in groups to be rewarding. I learned a great deal in a shorter time frame just by having a few
collaborating with others on a task.
