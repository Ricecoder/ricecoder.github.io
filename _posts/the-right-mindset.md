Dr. Carol Dweck, a Sanford psychologist and author of _Mindset:The New Psychology of Success_, has studied why people succeed, and come up with a new understanding on the matter. In her book, she writes about two mind sets she found people often had; fixed and growth.

People who have fixed mindsets believe that traits such as intelligence and talent are present at birth and are set for life. Any success one achieves is based on these inherent traits and not on effort or work. Thus, people with this mindset tend to seek only things they know they can be successful at in order to show, or prove, their intelligence.

People with the growth mindset believe that intelligence and abilities are developed through work or effort. They seek out opportunities to learn and grow because failure is a sign of learning rather than an indicator of their intelligence. They are often able to succed at learning new things because they approach without reservation and preserve despit temporary setbacks and failures.

I find that I have traits of both of these mindsets. On one-hand I believe that some people are born talented in certain areas, and that working hard will only get you so far. However, on the other-hand I believe that it takes work _and_ effort to succeed and that even if one is talented they will not go far if they donâ€™t work at it. I also find that I constantly am looking to learn something new and am not intimidated by failing.

Keeping a growth mindset while completing this course will be important. No one is born knowing how to code, and failure will be a constant thing, so it is important to view each setback as a temporary block until we figure out a solution. Our intelligence is not based on doing everything right but rather on our ability to continue to learn and adapt. With this mindset I will be able to continue learning and growing without worrying that I am "stupid" or "not talented enough" to code.
