##Reflections from Week Three

Working with CSS this week was a nice change. Compared to JavaScript, CSS was very straight forward and easy to comprehend. I enjoyed seeing the visual changes made as I worked on the code. While frustrating at times when I had to get the positioning right, I thought it was much easier to make a change and immediately be able to visualize what happened (or didn't) unlike in JavaScript.

This week I had the greatest success with the View Mode Switch site. I had become much better at organizing the code in my styles.css file and was able to really organize my file by using three parts; code for both views, code for only the grid view, and code for only the list view. I also labeled every CSS rule with what HTML element it applied to which helped when I needed to go back and make changes.

Additionally, I was excited to see that my JavaScript worked and that my view switched from grid to list when I clicked the appropriate link. It is a great feeling when two things you have worked hard on come together and work. It makes me look forward to future projects where I am writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
