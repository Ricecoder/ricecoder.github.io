##Week 6

This week we aquired several new tools to make our lives easier. First we started used [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) which is a JavaScript utility library. With this new tool we were able to use `.template` to make templates for the data we were collecting from the GitHub API. 

We also installed [Bower](http://bower.io/) this week. Bower is an awesome package manager for the web. Similar to NPM it allows you to install things on the command line like jQuery, however instead of downloading the whole jQuery library you get CDN links. 

My ability to leverage the package.json and bower.json files increased greatly this week. Being able to write scripts that you can call quickly on terminal is a blessing. Especially when working on multiple assignments in a short period of time. Not having to type out long commands for `node-sass` and `broswer-sync` speeds up the development process greatly.
