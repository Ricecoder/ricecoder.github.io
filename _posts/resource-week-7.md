##Resource Week 7

For this week's resource I would like to highlight a site that allows you to write, test, and tweak **Regular Expressions** or **RegEx**.

http://regexr.com/

On the left is a menu with references, cheatsheets, examples, and more. The main section to the right is where you can write 
RegEx to test on example text which you can replace with your own. 

There is also a video tutorial for how to use the site.
