###Journal Week 1

Week one at the Iron Yard was a rush of new information. While somewhat familiar with JavaScript I found learning the different components and syntax helpful. However, having to figure out the logic and write my own functions was challenging. 

Learning about the four primitive types; null, Booleans, Numbers, and Strings, helped solidify the building blocks of JavaScript. I was able to ask myself ‘what type is this?’ or ‘what type do I expect to get out of this statement?’. It allowed me to breakdown what I was seeing into smaller pieces that I could understand.
	
Studying function definitions and the three things functions have (Input, output, and side-effects) made determining what a function does easier. It also helped when trying to understand control flow as they are one of several things that can change the general flow of left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Other things that affect the control flow are loops, conditions (if-else statements etc..),  and op precedence (PMDAS). 
	
One of the hardest things to understand, but what is becoming an increasingly more important skill, is the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).  Writing tests to check if my logic is correct was hard at first but I am now seeing that they are an excellent way to make sure  my code is doing what I think it is. Red-Green-Refactor is something I am still trying to understand and do. However, the times I have adhered to it are times in which I feel that my code has been the strongest.
