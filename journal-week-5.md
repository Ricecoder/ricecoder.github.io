##Journal Week 5

This week we covered APIs, JSON files, IIFEs, and scope. 

APIs are Application Program Interfaces. In layman terms, APIs allow one program to interact with another. Let's use a restaurant analogy to help explain this.

At a restaurant a waiter (API) allows a diner (you/the user making the request for data etc.) to "interact" with the cook (software you are trying to making the request of). You want a burger (data) so you give your order (request for data) to the waitor. The waitor then takes that order (request) to the cook who makes your burger (data often in the form of a JSON), and gives it to the waitor who then delivers it to you.

This is a very simple explaination but it gets the basic idea across.

FOR TOMORROW: JSON FILES

FOR THE NEXT DAY: IIFES AND SCOPE
