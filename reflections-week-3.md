##Reflections from Week Three

This week I had success with the View Mode Switch site. 
* I was very organized and set up my styles.css file in three parts: Code for both views, code for only the grid view, and code for only the list view. I also labeled every css selector with what HTML element it applied to. This made making changes easier. 
* My JavaScript worked (HURRAY!) so when I clicked on the list link it switched to all css properties for the list view class and likewise for the grid view.
* I had the most problems with the styling of certain elements. I never was able to completely get the icon links to show up.
