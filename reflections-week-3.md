##Reflections from Week Three

This week we worked on the CSS for our blueprint websites. I enjoyed seeing the visual changes our code made. It was much easier to make a change and immediately be able to visualize what it did unlike in JavaScript.

I had the greatest success while working on the View Mode Switch site. By that point in our assignment I had become much better at organizing the code in my styles.css file. For this site I broke the code down into three parts; code for both views, code for only the grid view, and code for only the list view. I also labeled every css rule with what HTML element it applied to which helped when I needed to go back and make changes.

Additionally, I was excited to see that my JavaScript worked and that my view switched from grid to list when I clicked the appropriate link. It is a great feeling when two things you have worked hard on come together and work. It makes me look forward to future projects where I am writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
