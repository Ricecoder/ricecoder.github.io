Things I learned in week two:

1.) THE DOM!
  a. It's not pronounced D-O-M
  b. It is the "tree" framework that allows me to edit HTML elements in JavaScript (nodes)
  c. Enables events to be added to elements

2.) How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript combine to make awesome websites.
  a. HTML provides the content / general framework
  b. CSS styles the frame work with rules. Uses css selectors.
  c. JavaScript finds HTML elements/nodes and uses css selectors and events to change the appearance/layout of the page.

3.) The importance of pseudocode and team development.
  a. Pseudocode allows problems to be broken down and written out step by step
  b. Talking through a new project with a teams helps speed the process up.
  c. Bouncing ideas off of others allows you to see problems in a new way. Also allows you to cement your knowledge by teaching others.
