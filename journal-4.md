##Week 4 AKA The Week Things Got Real!

Week 4 was the most challenging week thus far. We took all of our beautiful Blueprint sites that we had worked _so_ hard on and DESTROYED them. We deleted all of our html and rebuilt it using the new-to-us boilerplates and the `yo` command. YoHo! 

Next we converted all of our css into sass. Same syntax but different arrangement (nesting). There was much frustration at this point as we navigated the `node-sass` command and avoided commiting our old css files. 

_Then_ we tackled our javascript, converting it all to jQuery. This wasn't too terrible as jquery is simpler than javascript but it was still frustrating when previous working functions no longer worked. 

And if all that wasn't enough we added a new assignment...the CHESSBOARD OF DOOM!!! This beast required everything from html and sass, to javascript and jquery. Plus, now we had a new js file and concept, the controller. Given more time to concentrate on the task I believe I would have enjoyed this assignment more. As it was I felt like I was tied to an anchor and pushed off the boat. 

Top off the week with a journal entry, a tutorial, and doing about 4 reviews a night, and you now know what coding boot camp is like.
