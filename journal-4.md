##Week 4 AKA The week things got real!

Week 4 we took all of our beautiful Blueprint sites that we had worked so hard on and DESTROYED them. We converted our css to sass, rebuilt the html, and converted the javascript to jquery. 

Not to mention we added a new project, the dreaded chess board, to our already full plates. Add a journal entry and a tutorial, and about 4 reviews every night and you have an idea of what our week was like.
