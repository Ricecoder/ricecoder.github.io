##How to Avoid Merge Conflicts When Starting An Assignment:
Getting merge conflicts as you are starting an assignment is a bummer! Here are some steps to take before you begin to help prevent them.

1. Create your Issue.
2. Go to your TERMINAL and do a quick `git status` to make sure you have nothing you need to push to Github. 
3. Go back to Github and click on Pull Requests in the upper nav bar and **MERGE** all open PRs from the last assignment. 
4. Create your new branch in TIY-Assignments.
4. Now go back to your TERMINAL and do `git pull` to bring the new branch down to your LOCAL repository. 
5. Do `git checkout <new branch name here>` to change to that branch. 
6. You should now be good to go!
